    <h3>Here's a time line of Dr. Borlaug's life:</h3>
    <ul id="tribute-info">
      <li><label class="year">1914</label> - Born in Cresco, Iowa</li>
        <li><label class="year">1933</label> - Leaves his family's farm to attend the University of Minnesota, thanks to a Depression era program known as the "National Youth Administration"</li>

          <li><label class="year">1935</label> - Has to stop school and save up more money. Works in the Civilian Conservation Corps, helping starving Americans. "I saw how food changed them", he said. "All of this left scars on me."</li>
            <li><label class="year">1937</label> - Finishes university and takes a job in the US Forestry Service</li>
              <li><label class="year">1938</label> - Marries wife of 69 years Margret Gibson. Gets laid off due to budget cuts. Inspired by Elvin Charles Stakman, he returns to school study under Stakman, who teaches him about breeding pest-resistent plants.</li>
                <li><label class="year">1941</label> - Tries to enroll in the military after the Pearl Harbor attack, but is rejected. Instead, the military asked his lab to work on waterproof glue, DDT to control malaria, disinfectants, and other applied science.</li>
                  <li><label class="year">1942</label> - Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant Pathology</li>
 <li><label class="year">1944</label> - Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont, leaves behind his pregnant wife, and flies to Mexico to head a new plant pathology program. Over the next 16 years, his team breeds 6,000 different strains of disease resistent wheat - including different varieties for each major climate on Earth.</li>
 <li><label class="year">1945</label> - Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each season, doubling wheat yields</li>
      </ul>

        <q>Borlaug's life and achievement are testimony to the far-reaching contribution that one man's towering intellect, persistence and scientific vision can make to human peace and progress.</q>
